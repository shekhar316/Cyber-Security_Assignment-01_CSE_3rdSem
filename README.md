# Cyber-Security_Assignment-01_CSE-3rdSemester
### Questions 
* Write a C/C++ program that takes n number of command line arguments and finds the least number. In case of invalid entered value, prompt the user to enter another value.
* Write a C/C++ program to check whether a string is palindrome or not.
* Write a C/C++ program that lists down all the prime numbers in a range between a and b, where a and b are two whole numbers.
* Write a C/C++ program to encrypt and decrypt the string using Caesar Cypher Algorithm. While encrypting the given string, 5 is added to the ASCII value of the characters. Similarly, for decrypting the string, 5 is subtracted from the ASCII value of the characters to print an original string. Example - Input String - hello, Encrypted String - mjqqt
* You are given a string (you need to take it input from user), the task is to encrypt this string
using # and $ symbols, alternatively. While encrypting the message the encrypted format must repeat
the symbol as many times as the letter position in alphabetical order (consider the string as case
insensitive).
